# C# Practice Projects

This repository is a collection of small but practical projects designed to facilitate the learning and application of **C# and .NET** fundamentals, with a focus on writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Each project demonstrates real-world utility â€” either as a developer tool or a foundation for more complex applications.

## Objectives

- Develop a deep understanding of C# and .NET features
- Apply and understand clean code and SOLID principles
- Build practical tools that reflect real-world needs
- Explore scalability and refactoring opportunities in each mini-project

## Current projects
